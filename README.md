## What problems did I encounter in doing this project? And how did I solve it?
          - I took the initial value as one. So first we can see one in the UI but if we want to update the value like two then we can't update in the UI.
                -- Here I used usestate() hook to solve this problem. Because the use is state hook first displays the initial value and then updates the previous value through the function and stores the updated value in the state and removes the previous value.
